        <h4>The Portfolio Creation</h4>
        <p>
          Creating this portfolio was a journey as I experimented with CSS
          elements in an attempt to make this website/ portfolio as unique as
          possile to me and still make it usable, accessible for users and
          ensure that the portfolio has a responsive design. The portfolio was
          created with an intention to givng a user or viewer in this case a
          full understanding of my skills and profiency with HTML, Javascript
          and CSS. My skills and understanding of Javascript however in this
          case is very basic. I used a little bit of Javascript for the navbar
          and for the mobile responsive design.
        </p>
        <h4>Challenges with creating the portfolio website</h4>
        <p>
          The overall styling of the portfolio and ensuring that I met the
          technical requirements of the assignment whilst ensuring the deisgn of
          the portfolio was still unique to me and was in line with my skill
          set. <br />
          Using media queries at first was confusing for me. I was not quite
          understanding if the max-width was starting from a certain point. For
          istance in my CSS one of media queries has a max-width of 600px (this
          is for the projects section) intially I assumed it was taking above
          600px then after understanding it I realised it was taking from below
          600px to 600px. The max width in the case is refering to maximum
          screen size of 600px. <br />
          Going forward, the first thing i would do would be to make the website
          with a mobile screen in mind first. I had difficulties in making sure
          that the text can be easily viewed and accessible via a mobile device.
